Hi!  
My name is Fife, and you've made it to my github page!

Here is where you will find some of my personal software/hardware development projects.

Most of the projects in these repositories are musical in nature, as music technology is somthing
that I have a bit of an obsession with.

Check out my musical electronics store:  
[Fife Electronics](https://fifeelectronics.com).
