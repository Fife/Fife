## Greetings!  
My name is Jacob Fifield, and you've made it to my github page!

This is where you will find some of my personal software/hardware development projects, as well as public facing contributions to university projects. Here is a little about myself and the work present on this github:

Before starting my journey as a Computer Engineering student I was an Audio Engineer, Stage Technician and Musician for over 10 years.    

A curiosity for what made my audio gear work is what brought me to Computer Engineering, so this github serves as a bit of an audio coding playground. To that end, I am currently working on building a DSP engine meant for embedded systems, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Fife/Fife-DSP).

I also dabble in competative programming. The most recent competition I participated in was the [Synmax Twitter Contest](https://synmax.com/home/synmax-twitter-contest/) where I placed in the top 10. My submission can be found [here](https://github.com/Fife/Proteus-ShipTracker).

I am currently looking for development work!
