## Greetings!  
My name is Jacob Fifield, and you've made it to my github page!

This is where you will find some of my personal software/hardware development projects, as well as public facing contributions to university projects. Here is a little about myself and the work present on this github:

Before starting my journey as an Embedded Systems Engineer, I had over a decade of experience in Audio Engineering, and Music. :control_knobs: :guitar: ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ’» 

A curiosity for what made my audio gear work is what brought me to Embedded Systems, so this github serves as a bit of an audio hardware and software development playground. To that end, I am currently working on building a DSP engine meant for embedded systems, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Fife/Fife-DSP). I also have some hardware designs that can be found [here](https://github.com/Fife/Hardware-Projects).

I also participate in competative programming and team projects:

2024 : [Smart Cryogenic Connector](https://github.com/IEEE-Robotics-Club/NASA-Minds-2024) for [NASA MINDS Undergraduate Student Design](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/murep/projects/nasa-minds.html). Our Team got 1st in the best overall systems engineering paper!

2023 : [TELLUS Swarming Robotic Resource Location System](https://github.com/IEEE-Robotics-Club/MSU-NASA-Minds-2023) for [NASA MINDS Undergraduate Student Design](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/murep/projects/nasa-minds.html) 

2022 : [Ground Penetrating Radar Simulation](https://github.com/Fife/MSU-Robotics-Club) for [NASA MINDS Undergraduate Student Design](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/murep/projects/nasa-minds.html) where our team was a finalist!
